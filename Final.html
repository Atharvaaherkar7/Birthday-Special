                    <p>Dear Vidya,</p>
                    <p>Another year, another chapter… and yet, you’re still the same—a little overthinker, a little dreamer, someone who doesn’t just see the world but deeply feels it. And that’s what makes you special.

You are the kind of person who finds beauty in the smallest things—a song that hits differently, a kind word from someone unexpected, or just the way the wind feels on your skin. You sometimes drift away into your own stories, but when you're with the people you love, you give them your whole heart.

So today, there’s only one wish—love yourself a little more. Give your overthinking mind a break. Just like you listen to others without judgment, listen to yourself too. And the love you pour into the world? Keep a little of it for yourself.

And most importantly, remember this—you are enough, just as you are.
                        birthday
                        wishes come true.</p>
